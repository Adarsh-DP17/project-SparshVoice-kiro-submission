**Assistant:**

I'll read the full requirements document and update it to follow the proper template format.

I can see the requirements document only has an Introduction section. I'll update it to follow the proper template by adding the missing sections: User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and Non-Functional Requirements. I'll keep the existing Introduction and expand it with well-structured requirements.

I've updated the requirements document to follow the proper template format. The document now includes:

- Introduction (kept your original content)
- User Stories covering the main personas and use cases
- Acceptance Criteria with specific, testable requirements organized by feature area
- Non-Functional Requirements covering performance, accessibility, reliability, scalability, and security

The requirements are structured around the core functionality: ISL-to-voice/text translation, voice-to-ISL translation, medical vocabulary support, and rural accessibility features. Each acceptance criterion is specific and testable, which will help guide the design and implementation phases.

Refine this into a structured professional requirements.md file with headings.

**Assistant:**

I'll refine the requirements document with better structure and professional headings to improve readability and organization.

I've refined the requirements document into a professional, well-structured format with clear hierarchical headings. The improvements include:

**Structure enhancements:**
- Numbered sections for easy reference
- Subsections with clear hierarchy (3.1, 3.1.1, etc.)
- Horizontal dividers between major sections
- Consistent formatting throughout

**Content improvements:**
- Expanded Introduction with Purpose and Scope subsections
- Reformatted User Stories with structured "As a/I want/So that" format
- Converted Acceptance Criteria into detailed Functional Requirements with specific subsections
- Enhanced Non-Functional Requirements with more specific metrics and categories
- Added new section: Constraints and Assumptions

**Professional touches:**
- Clear section numbering for cross-referencing
- Specific technical requirements (Android versions, RAM, latency targets)
- Comprehensive coverage of all aspects (performance, security, compatibility, maintainability)
- Better organization of related requirements

The document now follows professional requirements documentation standards and provides a solid foundation for the design phase.
